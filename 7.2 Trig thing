'''
Write and run a computer program to approximate a solution to
cos x — x = 0, where 0 < x <pi/2. The program should ask the user to
enter a small tolerance T, say T = 0.01, and continue to increment x by
0.001 until |cos x — x| < T. A value of x such that |cos x — x| < T should
be printed as an approximate solution to the equation cos x — x = 0.
